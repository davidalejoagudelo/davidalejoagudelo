## About me


"Hello! My name is David, agronomic engineer from the National University of Colombia, Bogotá campus 🎓.

I am passionate about understanding soils and plant physiology, as well as precision agriculture, data analysis, and automation oriented towards agricultural production 🌱👨🏼‍💻.

Throughout my university studies, I had the opportunity to support as a teaching assistant in courses on plant physiology and soil fertility management, guiding students on various proposed topics 👨🏼‍🏫 (2020 - 2022). On the other hand, I carried out the setup of trials and data analysis of experimental designs focused on plant biostimulation at the leaf and soil level 🧑🏼‍🌾 (2020 - 2022).

In parallel to this, the knowledge gained from personal projects has allowed me to install drip fertigation systems in vertical gardens and conduct trials on rose plants, as well as design and manufacture hydroponic systems and tools for measuring environmental variables and water quality, using commercial sensors, microcontrollers, and programming languages 🧑🏼‍💻 (2019 - present).

I am a follower of the implementation of technologies in the agricultural sector!"
